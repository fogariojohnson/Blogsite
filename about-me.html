        <p>For 9 years, I dedicated my life in teaching. I may not be the best teacher,
          but I considered myself growing every year with all the challenges I face.
          With all the responsibilities given to me as a School Coordinator who takes charge
          of the school when the School Director is not around. And I adapted to it and I get used to it.
        </p>
        <p>But then, in life, we also have to think of our private life to grow.
          So I made the biggest decision that I ever made in my entire life.
          I travelled 8,207 miles to be with the love of my life and build a home with him.
          We started as a couple with 2 dogs, Lucy and Lindsey (both golden retrievers).
          But then we grew, when our eldest, Isaac, came into our life like a starlight.
          And blessed with the second child, Gabriel, 2 years later.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, I decided that I will focus in building a family.
          I will make sure that I will be able to see the first years of my kids.
          And nurture them the value of family.  Because with those 9 years of my experience as a teacher,
          I've noticed that 80% of students that socially, emotionally and intellectually challenge lack the
          attention of their parents and others no parents at all that will guide them. And I will not let
          that happen to my own family.
        </p>
        <p>And now that they are more independent, I think I am ready to go back in enriching my professional skill.
          But this time, I want to be more flexible as a mother and as a career woman. So I chose a path which I first
          fell in love with. Computer, coding, designing and just expressing myself through art.
        </p>
