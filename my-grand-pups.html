        <p>Raising puppies was not totally planned.  It all started with an accident.
         Then we fell in love with the puppies and the feeling of fulfillment after you find a pup loving family.
         Being able to give joy to the family who always wanted to have a golden retriever in their family. </p>
        <p>I completely understand that feeling because before I married Paul, my husband, I always wanted to have one.
         But because of some health condition of a family member, it's not doable. For the sake of both parties,
         a family member and the pet.
        </p>
        <p>Now that I can have as many dogs as I want,(for now 6 golden retrievers and 1 siamese is enough),
       I want to share this joy to the family who deserves it.  But so you know, we don't just let anybody adopt our pups,
       we screen them.  We talked to them, and we let them sign an agreement. We don't impose, but we would love updates of the pup.
